# winFix
A repository of group policy editor flags that need to be set to make windows a useful operating system.

#Flags
<p>The following are flags that need to be set via group policy editor. Note that this only works on windows
11 Pro and not Home as gpedit.exe is not accessible on the home version of Windows 11. If you are on windows
10 this is not a problem and will work on all versions of the operating system. Note that some of the flags
listed are not going to be needed on windows 10 and are only needed on windows 11. These will be annotated. </p>
